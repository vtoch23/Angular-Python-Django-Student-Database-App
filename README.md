# Student Database Management Application

Full-stack web application for managing student records, built with Angular and Tailwind CSS on the frontend and Django on the backend. The project demonstrates CRUD functionality, REST API integration, relational database design, and automated testing.

## Overview
This application allows users to create, view, update, and delete student records through a responsive Angular interface styled with Tailwind CSS and backed by a Django REST API. It was built to practice full-stack development with Angular and Python, with particular emphasis on component testing, API communication, and database integration.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- Angular
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- HTML
- Cypress (component testing)

**Backend**
- Python
- Django
- Django REST Framework

**Database**
- sqlite3

**Tooling**
- Git
- Postman

## Key Features
- Student record creation, editing, and deletion (CRUD)
- Responsive UI styled with Tailwind CSS
- RESTful API for student data management
- Angular forms with data binding and validation
- Client–server data validation
- Persistent storage using a relational database

## Architecture & Design
- Angular frontend communicates with backend via REST APIs
- Django REST Framework exposes structured API endpoints
- Normalised relational database schema for student records
- Clear separation of concerns between frontend UI, API, and data layer

## Testing
- Cypress component tests for Angular components
- Backend API tests using Django’s test framework
- Manual API validation with Postman

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vtoch23/Angular-Python-Django-Student-Database-App.git
cd Angular-Python-Django-Student-Database-App

Run "python manage.py runserver" from main folder to run back-end.

Run "ng serve" from front-end folder to run front end.
